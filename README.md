# Object Length and Width Determination From An Image

## Introduction

This is a single page application developed using angular. The tool developed during our internship under Forest Research Institute which is used to determine the length and width of a tree from an image. This is developed with the help of mask RCNN which detects the tree and using a reference we calculated the height and width of the tree. This is implemented using Angular2.8 in the form of web app.

## Modules
* Manual Estimation:- User has to select the images manually.
* Automation:- Using the algorithms of detection like Mask RCNN, automatically the image got selected.

## Tools and Languages
* VsCode
* Angular
* Python 
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript

## libraries
* Angular Cropper
* Mask RCNN
* Keras
* Numpy


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
